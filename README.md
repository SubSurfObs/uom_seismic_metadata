# University of Melbourne Seismic Data

Purpose of This Repository

This GitHub repository is not the authoritative source for seismic metadata.
Instead, it functions as a public mirror of metadata that is curated, validated, and maintained elsewhere.

The definitive metadata for the University of Melbourne Seismic Network is managed through Gempa SMP:

🔗 https://smp.gempa.de
🔗 https://smp.gempa.de/dansand/uom_seismic_metadata

Gempa SMP provides the workflow for editing, validating, and exporting metadata, but the platform only supports downloading in SeisComP Markup Language (SCML) format. Because operational use often requires additional file formats—such as FDSN StationXML, deployment-organised inventories, and other derived representations—the GitHub repository serves the following purposes:

What this repository is for

* A unified location to store exported SCML and FDSN StationXML files
* A place to host metadata in multiple derived configurations, such as deployment-based or network-specific bundles
* A convenient location for downstream workflows, scripts, CI processes, or automated metadata consumers
* A public mirror, not an editable upstream source

What this repository is not for
* It is not where authoritative metadata is modified
* It is not a replacement for the Gempa SMP curation workflow
* Any edits made here would be overwritten by future exports and should therefore not be treated as canonical
